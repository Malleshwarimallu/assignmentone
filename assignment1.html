<p>The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal.
 They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.
 Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. 
There are more than 70 cat breeds,
 though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.</p>

<p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is a member of genus Canis (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, 
and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa,
 with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,
 which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
 sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>

<p>Rabbits can make great pets and tend to bond very closely with their owners.
 They can be extremely social, and love being around people, making them loyal companions.
 They also have a tendency to be very independent, which makes caring for them less stressful compared to other pets. 
Being very social and playful mammals, rabbits are easily distracted by toys. Training a rabbit can be quite easy, 
using similar techniques as one would train a dog.</p>

<p>Parrots have a heavy, in relation to their size, and compact body with a large head and a short neck. 
Their beaks are short, strong and curved. The two parts of the beak are very strong and used to break fruits and seeds.
 The tongue is large and strong.They have strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet (with two toes facing forward and two toes facing back) that are very useful to climb up trees. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. The plumage of cockatoos ranges from mostly white to mostly black,
 with a mobile crest of feathers on the tops of their heads.</p>

<p>They like to eat any kind of green shoots (flowers, veggies, grass etc.) as well as wheat, 
cracked corn or wild game feed. They can handle freezing temperatures as long as they have a dry perch that is out of the wind and weather.
 Dry dog and cat chows make excellent winter feed for peafowl, who are omnivores, eating insects, small snakes, lizards, 
grain, as well as many varieties of greens. </p>
